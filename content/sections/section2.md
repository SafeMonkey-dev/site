## Monkey strong together

> In 1961, the chimpanzee Ham became the first hominid to be catapulted into the cosmos aboard the Mercury Redstone rocket. It was thanks to this mission that NASA was able to carry out the first launch of an American astronaut, Alan Shepard.

Today we want to do the same thing with you guys. Let's be monkeys. Let's fly.
